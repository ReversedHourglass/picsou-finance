"""Reads the Sofidy Espace Associé portfolio table into a typed snapshot.

`3,clients.html` is server-rendered PHP: the fund table, the totals row and each
fund's `Code_Produit` are all in the initial HTML, so no browser and no
JavaScript evaluation is involved. What the page gives us is a `Valeur unitaire`
column, which its own footnote defines as the withdrawal price for a
capital-variable SCPI -- that is the figure a SCPI share is worth, and the one
the account balance is built from.

The portal is the single source of truth for the valuation, so this module never
derives one: `totalEur` is read from the row and used to check the snapshot, not
recomputed from `shareCount × price` and written back as if it were Sofidy's.
