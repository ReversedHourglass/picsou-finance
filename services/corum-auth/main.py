"""Read-only CORUM client-space authentication and SCPI positions sidecar.

Playwright drives the login form, then the session cookie is harvested off
the requests the SPA itself makes. CORUM gates nothing behind a captcha and,
on the account this was verified against, asks for no second factor -- so
unlike the Amundi sidecar there is no pending state and no `/complete`
round-trip: a login either yields a session or fails.

Two payload shapes are read, and they are not interchangeable. The contract
call knows the funds and the envelope but carries no unit price; the
per-fund call is the only place a withdrawal price appears. `positions_parser`
owns that split and the arithmetic; this file only owns the browser, the
session and the HTTP.

Credentials, session cookies and raw financial responses are never logged.
