"""Turns BoursoBank's dashboard HTML and trading JSON into the sidecar contract.

Three upstream shapes are parsed here:

* the account summary at `/dashboard/liste-comptes`, which is HTML grouped into
  `data-summary-bank` / `-savings` / `-trading` / `-loan` / `-insurance` /
  `-assurance` sections;
* the trading board's `accounts/summary/{id}` JSON, which carries the cash, the
  portfolio valuation, the account total and every open position;
* the identity selector at `/connexion/lister-identites`, which BoursoBank puts
  in front of the dashboard when one access holds a personal and a business
  identity.

Kept free of FastAPI and httpx, because these rules are the part that silently
breaks when BoursoBank reskins a page, and a silent break here would overwrite a
correct portfolio with a partial one. Nothing is ever coerced to zero and no row
is ever skipped to "recover": a card that looks like an account but does not
parse fails the whole sync, so the last known-good data survives.
