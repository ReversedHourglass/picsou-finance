/**
 * The image URL to show for a holding's crypto asset, resolved on demand.

 * <p>Crypto only, and deliberately so: the provider answers from the same coin-id registry that
 * prices crypto, so an equity ticker simply has no entry. Shares and funds take a different
 * route, {@link InstrumentLogoService}, because their only source is a scraped page whose result
 * has to be stored rather than re-asked (issue #162). Nothing above this class names a provider.
 *
 * <p>The cache is in-memory and long-lived, unlike {@code PriceService}'s 15-minute one, because
 * the value is not time-sensitive: a coin's mark does not go stale, and the URL is stable enough
 * that re-resolving it every quarter of an hour would spend CoinGecko calls to learn nothing. A
 * miss is remembered too, so an unmapped ticker is asked about once per TTL rather than on every
 * render of a page that lists it — but on a much shorter TTL, see
 * {@link #MISS_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS}.
